Hello there 👋
My name is Guillaume Arino (aka mGGk). I'm a developper working on many things.

I've started developpement in PHP in 2008, years laters,i've switched to Java to developp Minecraft plugins. Now I manly write Javascript/Typescript code because it's my job. I also write some C# and C++ code when i have time.

My favorite project is [AutoBleem](https://github.com/autobleem/AutoBleem), a Playstation Classic mod that allow people to load custom games and emulators, i've mainly worked on Save Manager and Emulator bugfixs.

I'm also part of the demoscene family as an Amiga developper (ASM68k and AMOS), i'm from the [Delicious Amigans](https://demozoo.org/groups/90490/) group.
